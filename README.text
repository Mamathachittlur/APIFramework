- I had to the send request twice for some scenarios and validate, as API caching the response and not returning right results every single time.

- I have used Rest Assured and cucumber for the framework

- You can find the cucumber reports after the execution under target>cucumber-html-reports

- End to end tests are working fine, I have noticed some times false failures due to the timing issues
